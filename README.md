Java Emotion Recognition Project
--------------------------------

Welcome to the Matt's Java Emotion Recognition Project (JEmotionRec). JEmotionRec is an application that takes an image of a person's face as input and outputs the emotion that they are expressing given a set of training data. JEmotionRec was originally developed as a project at the University of Waterloo and has since been migrated here and transformed into a more general purpose tool.

JEmotionRec is authored and maintained by Matt Pillar <mpillar@uwaterloo.ca>

Enjoy the project!
