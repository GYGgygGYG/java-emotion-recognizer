Java Emotion Recognition
---

JEmotionRec is an application that takes an image of a person's face as input and outputs the emotion that they are expressing given a set of training data.

This project was originally developed as a project at the University of Waterloo and has since been migrated here and transformed into a more general purpose tool.
